  **Different 2017**  
 Between trance has arrived at the end of 2017, 2017 for me is definitely one of the greatest life years, is almost a year is the turning point in life, because, in this year, I finished my studies, smooth degree and diploma from the shandong university of science and technology.  
 Remember, at the beginning of time, I just practice for two months, the first internship or present outbound d, daily work content is between company and customers, while the daily work content is very easy, don't have to clock in, working time is free, don't have to get up early, and can work early in the afternoon, although look good, but from the inside of the heart is that I don't like this job, may be interested in, every day around always give me a sense of job erratic, I am more inclined to punch in every day, fixed work time from work, sitting in my office every day, step-by-step study and work.  
 Especially in the second month of the internship, need to go to the company's warehouse staff training, at the time when I still lived in songjiang, the company is to require 9:30 to check in on time every day, are the company's warehouse in pudong new area, close to tang town, and is not close to the subway station, the last of the need for a road bus, every day I come from Shanghai to the east of the west through the city to Shanghai, it takes about two hours on the road, so that time I will get up at half past six every day, arrive at the subway station around 7 PM.  
 Continue to the end of the training, but during this time there is a very important problem bothering me, all know that the high cost of living in Shanghai, at the time of the internship salary is only 150 yuan a day, and more than 800 part to pay the tax of twenty percent, when it is less than three thousand yuan, the money to tuition fee is RMB 1656 yuan per month, the rest is hardly enough to eat and rent.  
 Was the only way to think about is in a high paying job, may be someone who speaks more than thousand of internship is the normal salary, this I know, but the reality of pressure, I have to go looking for a job with a higher, the night on his resume, have also received a phone call from some HR, because at that time, I have to work every day, don't have time to interview, so I just choose from those calls out of the two, and HR, agreement on the same day the interview, one morning in the afternoon, the day I went to the interview asks for leave, in the morning that is near the xujiahui, companies are ok, but don't intern went to the room, so hopeless, the operational leader told me some job planning and study plan, also be very fruitful, not white.  
 In the afternoon I have in a hurry to get one, the company is in jing 'an district 188 jiangning road, why remember so clear, could have guessed, I successfully entered the company, at the time the interview, the manager asked some basic things, and then said work is the need to shift work, I realized that it is monitoring work, is also a kind of operations, is one of the most difficult, he said to me, although this work is to monitor but is different from other monitoring, because it is night when monitoring, when the day is can learn operations.  
 And salary is 6 k a month, I was attracted by the salary to, return to wanted to think they agreed, the manager said that if we find two people will be able to start to work after New Year's day, so I have sold two in my classmates and I go together.  
 This kind of salary is quite high among my classmates over the same period.  
 Because most of them were only around four thousand, so few of them could reach five thousand, and I got to six thousand, which was known to many classmates, including that one.  
 Maybe it's a predestination.  
 When work is day shift down continuously, day and night shift are 12 h, no double cease day, sounds very hard, but also good, the day after 24 hours on the night shift, then after 48 hours on day shift, a month on a total of 15 classes, white night half and half.  
 Wages have life is not a problem at that time, still have some left, is there anything you want to buy also have the ability to buy, but I'm more cherish, just changed a mobile phone, though the phone was unfortunately happened but can what to say again, you never know, who can guarantee that it is really a bad thing, anyway, god always fair, want their own efforts to fight for, but would not have belongs to own thing, don't look so heavy it.  
 Work finally settle down, they started to graduation design, the leadership of the company is good, as long as schools need when I go back, I could always call down to ask for leave, but also not deduct our wages.  
 Graduation design is not very difficult, as long as finishing the subject and learning the 15k words of graduation thesis will be ok.The review rate of the paper is no more than 30%, and my thesis is all handed, so it is easy to check it, and it is less than 15%, which is already very low.  
 June was the day when I went back to school, and I had three weeks' leave. This time, I was going to deduct my salary, and I was playing around in school, eating with friends I hadn't seen for a long time.  
 This time back to Shanghai after graduation, I began to consider one of the more important question, is the current job can't go on for a long time, there are two reasons, one can learn the job really is too little, and the night shift and carry a lot of pressure, sleep is a problem, secondly, the job for more than half a year, shift work form body cannot cope, although young but also should cherish good body.  
 At that time has come to July, because of the change to work not as urgent as last time, so I am basically looking at various position information, a resume is not thrown a, though this, but still have received a phone call a few HR, then also try holding the attitude to the called the downtown core semiconductor company, to feel after the company also is pretty good, environment is very good, at least one is good too.  
 The company size also is very big, the interview time spent about two hours, and Roger and jack talked a lot, self rating, the interview results have 80 points, the last HR find me talk about the salary I mention is 8 k, she let me back after such notice, believe that everyone will meet the plot, such as notice the words also let everyone and clinking.At that time I didn't think much of it is to change your job, as you don't succeed effect is not very big for me, I remember the time the interview is on Tuesday, according to the common sense, if no notice is laid before Friday, I think of it, so the mood is very depressed at the weekend.  
 On Monday to go to work again, at that time, have to be in a better mood, thinking about the big deal to keep looking, and leadership was already feel that I want to change my job, I also don't understand how he know, whatever, both leaders that morning to find my conversation, say don't change, a time he would help me to recommend a better one.I was really talking and thinking about not waiting for a few more months, but the world just had so many coincidences that I got a call when I got an offer in less than an hour.The mood at that time was really complicated, thinking about how to talk to the leader.The day was not said, the evening chat with her lead, the next day I sent WeChat messages to the leader said this matter, the leader did not say, return two weeks to be able to leave formally.After seeing the reply, there was a sudden little excitement in my heart.  
 On August 15, 2017, I came to this company called brite, in the new company, I experienced a lot, also learned a lot at the same time, the decision that check my choice is right, even though the company is in trouble now, but I think I should stick to it, 2017 this year really different...
